Competition rules

Objective: predict the CARAVAN column of the evaluation data
The description of the dataset and the task can be found in https://github.com/szbela87/ml_22_elteik/blob/main/mp2/description_task.txt
These rules are available at https://github.com/szbela87/ml_22_elteik/blob/main/mp2/rules.txt

The dataset is available at https://github.com/szbela87/ml_22_elteik/tree/main/mp2
Training set: ticdata2000.txt
Testing set: ticeval2000.txt

Models:
    first competition: only random forests
    second competition: any model

Metric: balanced accuracy
    = (TPR + TNR) / 2, where
    TPR = TP / (TP + FN),
    TNR = TN / (TN + FP))
    TP, FP, TN, FN are the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives

Submission format: .txt file, the nth row should be your prediction for the nth element of the test set; 
filename should be mldl_competition2_[your_name]_submission[competition_id].txt. 
[competition_id] is 1 or 2.
Pay attention to submit your predictions in the same order as they are in the test set. (ticeval2000.txt)
You can submit one file for each competition.
Also submit your notebooks, e.g., you can share with me all your work in a Google Drive directory.
Also export your notebook to html or pdf format.
The Google Collaboratory notebook should be able to reproduce the HTML/PDF file if I restart the kernel and run all cells.
The notebooks should be named as the prediction submissions: mldl_competition2_[your_name]_submission[competition_id].html or pdf and ipynb.
Your code should be clear and commented.

The deadline is April 5, 23:59.
The next weeks after the assignment is given out, during the practice part of the course, you will have a chance to consult with me and ask for help if you have a problem.
For that, you have to submit a work in progress notebook by the next Friday after the assignemnt is given out. 
At the end of the three weeks, during the practice, the winners will be announced, and some people will be asked to present their solution.

The points recieved of your work does not depend on the result in the competitions. 
To achieve the maximum score for a mini-project, the following must be done:

1. participate in at least one competition,
2. fine-tune the hyperparameters,
3. the solution must be well-commented, and the code should be clean,
4. the submitted work must be complete, meaning not a single file required for submission is missing.
