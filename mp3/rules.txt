Rules: NO PREPROCESSING, ONLY MODEL TUNING. 
In this competition you can not modify the data 
(only division by 255 is allowed, PCA is not allowed either). 
You have to focus on model choice and hiperparameter optimization.

Categories: 
1. Boosting models
2. Freestyle

Submission: You have to submit your Kaggle score, your  (screenshots) 
and your notebooks (like in the first competition). You will be ranked 
based on your evaluation score on Kaggle. In this competition you have 
to submit through a Kernel on Kaggle. 

Submission format: the filenames should be 
mldl_competition3_[your_name]_submission[category_id].* 
Here, [category_id] is 1 or 2. 
You can submit one file for each competition.

Recommendations:
Also submit your notebooks, e.g., you can share with me all your work in
a Google Drive directory. Also export your notebooks to html or pdf 
format. The Google Colaboratory notebooks should be able to reproduce 
the HTML/PDF file if I restart the kernel and run all cells.
The notebooks should be named as the prediction submissions: 
mldl_competition3_[your_name]_submission[category_id].html or pdf and ipynb.
Your code should be clear and commented.
