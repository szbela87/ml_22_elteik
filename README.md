# Introduction to Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Additional Machine Learning course materials, ELTE Faculty of Informatics - 2024/25 spring semester

## Course Structure and Grading

- **20%** of the final grade comes from homework assignments.
- **20%** comes from practical session performance.
- **60%** comes from four mini-projects (each has a two-week deadline, see schedule below).
- **No final exam** for this course.

## About the Mini-Projects

- There will be **4+1 mini-projects** throughout the semester.
- You must complete at least **3** mini-projects to receive a grade.
- Solutions must be submitted via **Canvas** before the strict deadline.
- Late submissions (up to 24 hours) will receive **half** the available points.
- Plagiarism is strictly prohibited.
- You are encouraged to use external resources but must **cite them properly**.

### Grading Scale

- **50%** â†’ Pass (2)
- **60%** â†’ Satisfactory (3)
- **80%** â†’ Good (4)
- **90%** â†’ Excellent (5)

## Course GitHub Repository

[Course GitHub Page](https://github.com/szbela87/ml_22_elteik) - Contains data files and other materials.

## Homework and Practice Work Instructions

- Submit a **shared link** to a Google Colab notebook.
- Ensure that the notebook executes correctly using **"Run all"**.
- Perform a **"Kernel restart and run all"** before submission.

## Mini-Project Instructions

- Submit a **Google Colab notebook**.
- Ensure the notebook executes properly using **"Run all"**.
- Each mini-project includes:
  - A **dataset**.
  - A **task** (e.g., classification, clustering, etc.).
  - Two **competitions**: 
    1. Best performance using a specific method.
    2. Best performance using **any** technique.
- Achieving high scores is **not mandatory**, but:
  - Placing in the **top 3 at least 3 times** guarantees a **grade of 5** (if all 3 projects are submitted).
- You must submit a **work-in-progress notebook** by the following **Friday**.
- The final deadline is **three weeks** after assignment, on **Fridays at 23:59:59 PM**.
- Winners are announced and some students will present their solutions.

### Submission Format

- Submit as a **Google Colab notebook**.
- Include an **HTML file** containing the outputs.
- Provide a **text file** summarizing results and methods.
- The notebook should be **reproducible** (restart kernel, run all).
- Code should be **clear, well-commented, and documented**.
- Consider using a **GitHub repository** for better organization.
- Example notebook: [`project_work_1/project_1.ipynb`](https://github.com/szbela87/ml_22_elteik)

## Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Loading data**
2. **Describing data** (categorical, continuous, etc.)
3. **Data cleaning** (handling NaNs, duplicates, text conversion)
4. **Feature distribution and correlation analysis**
   - Histograms
   - Box plots
   - Scatter plots
5. **Data normalization**
6. **Training models**
7. **Evaluation metrics**:
   - Accuracy, confusion matrix
   - ROC-AUC curve
   - Positive predictive value (PPV), Negative predictive value (NPV)
