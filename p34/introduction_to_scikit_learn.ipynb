        "2. **Press SHIFT+TAB** - See you can the docstring of a function (information on what the function does) by pressing **SHIFT + TAB** inside it. Doing this is a good habit to develop. It'll improve your research skills and give you a better understanding of the library.\n",
        "3. **Search for it** - If trying it on your own doesn't work, since someone else has probably tried to do something similar, try searching for your problem. You'll likely end up in 1 of 2 places:\n",
        "    * [Scikit-Learn documentation/user guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) - the most extensive resource you'll find for Scikit-Learn information.\n",
        "    * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - this is the developers Q&A hub, it's full of questions and answers of different problems across a wide range of software development topics and chances are, there's one related to your problem.\n",
        "    * [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - ChatGPT is very good at explaining code, however, it can make mistakes. Best to verify the code it writes first before using it. Try asking \"Can you explain the following code for me? {your code here}\" and then continue with follow up questions from there.\n",
        "    \n",
        "An example of searching for a Scikit-Learn solution might be:\n",

        "Searching this on Google leads to the Scikit-Learn documentation for the `GridSearchCV` function: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html\n",
        "\n",
        "The next steps here are to read through the documentation, check the examples and see if they line up to the problem you're trying to solve. If they do, **rewrite the code** to suit your needs, run it, and see what the outcomes are.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Ask for help** - If you've been through the above 3 steps and you're still stuck, you might want to ask your question on [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) or in the ZTM Machine Learning and AI Discord channel. Be as specific as possible and provide details on what you've tried.\n",

For example, you can shop for 4-door cars or shop for 5-door cars (which always confused me since where's the 5th door?).

And if your model perfectly predicts a range of numbers it's R^2 value would be 1. Higher is better.\n",
